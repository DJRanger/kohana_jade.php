A simple wrapper for jade.php so that it can be used with Kohana 3.

To install it, just place it in your modules folder and enable it in your bootstrap.

By default it will cache the generated PHP files and use those when Kohana::$environment != Kohana::DEVELOPMENT.

You may change when it caches, where and what extension to use in the config file.
